                  Symptoms of COVID-19 can vary from person to person. Symptoms
                  may also vary in different age groups. Some of the more
                  commonly reported symptoms include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>new or worsening cough</li>
                  <li>shortness of breath or difficulty breathing</li>
                  <li>temperature equal to or over 38°C</li>
                  <li>feeling feverish</li>
                  <li>chills</li>
                  <li>fatigue or weakness</li>
                  <li>muscle or body aches</li>
                  <li>new loss of smell or taste</li>
                  <li>headache</li>
                  <li>
                    gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, diarrhea,
                    vomiting)
                  </li>
                  <li>feeling very unwell<br /></li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Children have been more commonly reported to have abdominal
                  symptoms, and skin changes or rashes.
                </p>
                <p>In severe cases, infection can lead to death.</p>
                <p>
                  Symptoms may take up to 14 days to appear after exposure to
                  COVID-19.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Evidence indicates that the virus can be transmitted to others
                  from someone who is infected but not showing symptoms. This
                  includes people who:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>have not yet developed symptoms (pre-symptomatic)</li>
                  <li>never develop symptoms (asymptomatic)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  While experts know that these kinds of transmissions are
                  happening among those in close contact or in close physical
                  settings, it is not known to what extent. This means it is
                  extremely important to follow the proven

                  As we continue to see transmission of the virus within
                  different communities, we know that everyone must take
                  precautions, even those who have not travelled outside of
                  Canada.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In an effort to prevent the spread of COVID-19 within
                  communities and across the country, all Canadians are advised
                  to:

                <ul>
                  <li>

                  <li>do not gather in groups</li>
                  <li>
                    limit contact with people at higher risk, such as older
                    adults and those in poor health

                  <li>go outside to exercise but stay close to home</li>
                  <li>
                    if you leave your home, always keep a distance of at least 2
                    arms lengths (approximately 2 metres) from others

                      <li>
                        household contacts (people you live with) do not need to
                        distance from each other unless they are sick or have
                        travelled in the last 14 days

                  If you go out for a walk, do not congregate and always
                  practise physical (social) distancing by keeping at least 2
                  metres apart from others at all times.

                  Together, we can slow the spread of COVID-19 by making a

                <p>
                  Coronaviruses&nbsp;are one of the easiest types of viruses to
                  kill with the appropriate disinfectant product when used
                  according to the label directions. Health Canada has published
                  a&nbsp;<a

                <p>
                  Although they do not claim to kill COVID-19, cleaners can play
                  a role in limiting the transfer of microorganisms. Health
                  Canada recommends cleaning high-touch hard surfaces often,
                  using either regular household cleaners or diluted bleach
                  according to the label directions. This bleach solution should
                  be prepared according to the instructions on the label or in a
                  ratio of 250 mL (1 cup) of water per 5 mL (1 teaspoon) of
                  bleach. Directions are based on bleach that is 5% sodium
                  hypochlorite, to give a 0.1% sodium hypochlorite solution.
                  Never mix bleach with other chemical products and use it in a
                  well-ventilated area.

                <p>
                  Medical masks, including surgical, medical procedure face
                  masks and respirators (like N95 masks), must be kept for
                  health care workers and others providing direct care to
                  COVID-19 patients.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Wearing a non-medical mask or face covering while out in
                  public is <strong>recommended</strong> for periods of time
                  when it is not possible to consistently maintain a 2-metre
                  physical distance from others, particularly in crowded public
                  settings, such as:
                </p>

                  Public health officials will make recommendations based on a

                <p>
                  COVID-19 is a serious health threat, and the situation is
                  evolving daily. The risk will vary between and within
                  communities, but given the increasing number of cases in
                  Canada, the risk to Canadians is considered
                  <strong>high</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This does not mean that all Canadians will get the disease. It
                  means that there is already a significant impact on our health
                  care system. If we do not flatten the epidemic curve now, the
                  increase of COVID-19 cases could impact health care resources
                  available to Canadians.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The risk for COVID-19 may be increased for certain settings

                <h3 id="products">Survival of coronaviruses on surfaces</h3>
                It is not certain how long COVID-19 survives on surfaces, but it
                seems to behave like other coronaviruses. Preliminary
                information on COVID-19 suggests that the virus may persist on
                surfaces for a few hours or up to several days depending on
                different conditions, such as:
                <ul>
                  <li>temperature</li>
                  <li>type of surface</li>
                  <li>humidity of the environment</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Surfaces frequently touched with hands are most likely to be
                  contaminated, including:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>tables</li>
                  <li>handrails</li>
                  <li>doorknobs</li>
                  <li>electronics</li>
                  <li>countertops</li>
                  <li>light switches</li>
                  <li>faucet handles</li>
                  <li>cabinet handles</li>
                  <li>elevator buttons</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Products shipped within or from outside of Canada could also
                  be contaminated. However, because parcels generally take days
                  or weeks to be delivered, and are shipped at room temperature,
                  the risk of spread is <strong>low</strong>. There is no known
                  risk of coronaviruses entering Canada on parcels or packages.

                  Scientists and food safety authorities across the world are
                  closely monitoring the spread of COVID-19.

                  If we become aware of a potential food safety risk,
                  appropriate actions will be taken to ensure the safety of
                  Canada's food supply.

                  The current spread of COVID-19 is a result of human-to-human
                  transmission. There is no evidence to suggest that animals
                  infected by humans are playing a role in the spread of this
                  disease. Animals and COVID-19 is an area that continues to be
                  studied by scientists.
